## Instagram Best Time to Post Predictor

This Python code uses a linear regression model to predict the best time to post on Instagram based on various attributes of a post, such as the day of the week, number of followers, likes, and comments.

### Installation
To run the code, you will need to have Python 3.x and the following libraries installed:
* pandas
* scikit-learn

You can install the libraries using pip or conda package managers.

### Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the code files to your computer.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder where the code is stored.
3. Run the command `python main.py` to execute the code.
4. The program will load the data from the CSV file and split it into training and testing sets.
5. The linear regression model will be trained on the training data using the scikit-learn library.
6. The code will create a new post with the desired attributes (day of the week, number of followers, likes, and comments) and use the trained model to predict the best time to post.
7. The predicted best time to post will be displayed in the console.

Note: You can modify the attributes of the new post in the `new_post` variable to see how the predicted best time to post changes.

### Disclaimer
This code provides a simple example of using machine learning for social media optimization, but the accuracy of the predictions may vary depending on the quality and quantity of training data and the choice of input features. Use it at your own risk.
