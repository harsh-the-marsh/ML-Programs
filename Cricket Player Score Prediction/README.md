## Cricket Player Performance Prediction using Machine Learning

### Introduction

This Python program uses machine learning to predict an IPL player's future score based on their past performance. The program loads the player's match data from a CSV file, splits the data into training and test sets, creates a Linear Regression model, and evaluates its performance using mean squared error.

### Requirements

To run this program, you will need the following libraries and dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- NumPy

### Data

The program uses a CSV file containing the player's past match data. The file should have the following fields:

- Total balls faced
- Total score

### Usage

To use this program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries and dependencies.
3. Open the program in your Python editor of choice.
4. Modify the path to the CSV file containing the player's match data.
5. Run the program.

The program will output the mean squared error of the model's performance on the test data and make a prediction for a new match based on the player's past performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement

Here are some suggestions for how to improve or extend this program:

- Use different machine learning algorithms, such as Decision Trees or Random Forests.
- Incorporate additional features, such as the number of boundaries (4s and 6s) scored in each match.
- Train the model on a larger dataset containing more matches for the player.
